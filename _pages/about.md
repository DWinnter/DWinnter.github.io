<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a undergraduate student in senior year at [College of Computer Science and Technology,](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). During my bachelor years, I've accomplished numerous [academic courses](https://bksy.zju.edu.cn/_upload/article/files/14/1d/ce579d614c9f9c920d21873a7c5d/62a39cc7-675e-4f14-a31e-4e406a0949ea.pdf) including Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, AI and so on. Meanwhile, I had 4 major extracurriculum acadmic/project experiences in [Human and Computer Interaction](#hci), [Data Visualization](#dv), [Cybersecurity](#cyber), and [Large Language Models](#llm). This summer, I visited University of Pennsylvania and cooperated with Prof. [Weijie Su](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/suw/) on a project regarding efficient tokenization for LLMs, which was now [under review](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QIBLeMtyMS&noteId=QIBLeMtyMS) in AISTATS 2025. Currently, I am working on my bachelor thesis under guidance of Prof. [Shouling Ji](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/sji#0) and senior members in [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/).

Apart from academic education in College of Computer Science and Technology, I pursued diversity and well-rounded development as well. I took a minor in [Zhejiang University Chu-kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/2022/0225/c44633a2500660/page.htm), with [courses](./pyfayl_cxPyfaylPdf.pdf) covering Economics and Entrepreneurship.

Research on a new tokenizer, aimed to represent more words in one token: [**Repository**](https://github.com/DWinnter/tokenizers_clique_partition)
- Proposing a new tokenization method for LLMs, with maximizaing average token length as its goal. Utilizing clique partition algorithm to find the largest-covering clique in the corpus, as the new token found for each round.
- A paper written on this topic, [Length-Maximization Tokenization for Language Models: An Approximation Algorithm](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=QIBLeMtyMS).

Developed a detection system for AIGC content that improves detection accuracy and robustness through multi-feature fusion and adversarial training: [**Repository**](https://github.com/DWinnter/DragonZhu)
- Key features include:
  - High-precision detection algorithm based on multi-feature fusion, combining spatial-temporal feature differences from images and audio to enhance detection performance in complex multi-modal scenarios
  - Robust detection against attacks through data augmentation and defensive distillation techniques to strengthen model resistance to adversarial attacks
- The system efficiently and accurately identifies AIGC content across multiple modalities while protecting user privacy through homomorphic encryption, providing solutions to security challenges posed by AIGC

**üéâ Highlights:**
- This project won the first prize in [The China International College Students' Innovation Competition (2024)](https://www.pilcchina.org/home), outstanding as the top 100 among 5140000 projects this year.
- We are selected as the only undergraduate team to report and interact with [the Minister of Education of China](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ieVh0foME9xea7sK_usyYg) at the Achievement Exhibition affliated with the competition.
- We are invited to a [symposium](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ceJu9Fponx0C2vQo96Sjbg) held by the headmaster of Zhejiang University, where I made an report as well.

Participated in a research project on human-computer interaction under the guidance of Professor Wang Guanyun from Zhejiang University and Professor Xiang Anthony Chen from UCLA.

Details:
- It's my first research, at the beggining year of my college life. We investigated novel interaction design approaches to reduce over-reliance on wearable fitness trackers
- I Led software development and independently developed an Android app for an 8-week user study after self-learning Android Studio
- We Conducted comprehensive user studies across 8 weeks and 20 participants to validate the effectiveness of identity-based interface design and developed practical solutions to promote healthier relationships with fitness tracking technology
- Eventually we wrote a paper and submitted it to CHI 2023, however, unfortunately it was rejected lol. But I still think it's a good work and a valuable experience for me. You can view it if interested. [Take Off Your Sports Watch: Designing Identity-based Interface to Reduce the
Over-reliance of Physical Activity Monitoring Wearables](./_pages/Watchoff_for_CHI.pdf)
